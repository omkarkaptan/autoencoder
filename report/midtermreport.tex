% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table

% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction to Auto-encoders}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Auto-encoder is a type of neural network for unsupervised learning. In this learning approach, inferences from an unlabeled training dataset are used to train a learning model. A set of 1 or more hidden layers are used to learn a compressed representation (encoding) of the input data. Typically, this is a lower dimensional representation of the input data. The objective of an Auto-encoder is to learn to produce an encoding for a given input which will best describe the input as closely as possible.

\section{Project Details}
This project requires implementation of an Auto-encoder from scratch that could learn a lower dimensional representation of 32x32 images of human faces. This implementation is to be done without the use of any existing neural net libraries. Our efforts are directed towards an implementation that could work with an arbitrary number of layers and neurons per layer.

The major components involved in the implementation of an Auto-encoder are described below.
\subsection{Neural Net Structure and Weight Matrices}
The basic components of a neural net are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Neuron: This is the basic unit of a neural network which is characterized by an activation function. The neuron is fired by producing an output when an input value is provided to the activation function.
	\item Layer and weight matrix: A layer is composed of one or more neurons. The neurons in two consecutive layers are connected by weighted edges between a given layer and its next layer. The weighted edges between 2 layers can be viewed as a weight matrix which is an MxN matrix where M is the number of neurons in a given layer and N is the number of neurons in its subsequent layer. A weight matrix is shown below.	
	$$A_{m,n} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
	a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
	\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
	a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n} 
	\end{pmatrix}
	$$
\end{itemize}
The layers in an Auto-encoder have a specific organization. The first layer is called an input layer which is the input to the neural network. The last layer is called the output layer which has the same dimension as that of the input layer. This layer attempts to reconstruct the input from the encoding that the neural net generates so that it can be compared with the original input to evaluate the performance of the encoder.


\subsection{Activation Function}
The neuron in a layer is a computational unit that takes inputs and provides an output based on an activation function. The activation functions are non linear in nature and typically have a derivative value which is simple to calculate during backpropagation. There are many activation functions like sigmoid or tanh. 

The sigmoid function is chosen for this project which is represented as:
\begin{equation}
f(n) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Feedforward}
The feedforward of the neural network is the first step in training an Auto-encoder. In this step, a batch of training images passes through the neural network. Each image produces an output which is measured against the original image to check accuracy of the Auto-encoder.

In this step, each neuron in an arbitrary layer receives an input from the output of the previous layer along with a bias input, each multiplied with a weight which indicates the importance given to this value while providing it as an input to the neuron. Thus, a cumulative input to a given layer is easily calculated by taking a dot product of the output of its previous layer with the input weight matrix for the layer in consideration. The activation function of each neuron in the layer is then fired for the cumulative input provided to it to get an output for this layer which is then propagated to the next layer. In this way, the input is propagated all the way through the neural net to produce an output.

\subsection{Error Function}
The error function is used to evaluate the accuracy with which the Auto-encoder can reconstruct the original input from the encoding. This error is calculated by comparing the result produced by the output layer with the original input provided to the input layer. A backpropagation algorithm is used to reduce the overall error of the neural net so that the reconstruction is as close to the input as possible. The error function chosen for this project is the root mean squared error function which is represented as:
\begin{equation}
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{1}^{n} \left(input - output\right)^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Back Propagation}
An Auto-encoder needs to be trained to produce a lower dimensional encoding which will represent the original input as closely as possible. After completing a feedforward for a batch input, the error function will provide a measure of how far off the neural network is from the input. The back propagation phase will use this error measure to update the weight matrices in the neural net in a direction such that the weight change will help reduce the error. To achieve this, a partial differential has to be calculated of the error with respect to the weight at each layer. This can be calculated by using the chain rule for partial derivatives.

\section{Implementation Details}
This section of the report describes about the technical implementation including design and architecture in building the Auto-encoder.

\subsection{Languages and libraries}
The language chosen is Python for this project. The numpy library was extensively used for performing mathematical operations like dot products or matrix operations for example. The PyUnit framework is used to write unit tests for this project.

\subsection{Design}
An object oriented approach is chosen to design the Auto-encoder. An object is created for the neural net and for each entity of the neural network, namely, a layer and the weight matrix. This approach allows for a flexible and modular design. It is possible to initialize a neural network containing any number of layers and any number of neurons per layer. The design of the neural net is made inherently extensible by appropriate use of python features and design principles. For example, the activation function and error function to be used by the neural network follow a common signature and can be passed to the neural network as a parameter. Along with this, several utility functions have been implemented to handle common tasks like file handling and image handling.

\subsection{Implementation Progress}
The present implementation of the Auto-encoder has a working neural network which can perform a single pass including a feedforward operation and a back propagation operation on a single image input without any programming error. However, the implementation of backpropagation has some issues which are being resolved at present. The bias has also been accounted for in this implementation.
\section{Problems faced}
One of the first challenges faced was to understand how a neural network and Auto-encoder works. Since neither member in the team had studied neural nets in the past, the first step was to do that. Several online resources and video lectures were referred to get a clear understanding of how a neural net works. It was easy to understand the principles of an Auto-encoder once the functioning of a neural network was clear.

The second challenge that is being dealt with is understanding the subtleties of the backpropagation algorithm. This is key in designing a dynamically sized Auto-encoder.

Another challenge being faced presently is the validation of the results obtained when an image is passed.

\section{Next steps and time line}
Although a single pass can be performed on a single image, the learning phase is not complete yet. After perfecting the implementation of the backpropagation algorithm, the next steps in the implementation are to add batch processing, learning rate and an epoch. Measures will then be taken to improve the accuracy of the Auto-encoder and obtain the required visualizations for the trained neural net. The implementation is expected to complete by November 25th and final report and poster by 30th November.

\section{Distribution of Responsibilities}

A majority of the learning and design phases have been done as a pair. Once that was clear, the implementation responsibilities were distributed.
